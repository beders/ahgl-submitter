# ahgl-submitter

This is a simple chrome extension to help manage a team roster for the Afterhours Gaming League, specifically for StarCraft 2.
It will import your roster, match ID and team name from Battlfy and add a toolbar to Chrome to help you manage the team and create a valid
`lineup` command for the matchup submission process.

The extension is live at [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ahgl-submitter/bipjipikmccdncmoepfhbgldbnmahnbc?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)

# Build

No build process really. Check out and load the extension in chrome:extension (enable Dev mode first).
Run pack to package the extension for store submission (you might have to change the name of the extension if you want to fork it).
